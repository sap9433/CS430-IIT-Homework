Professor Teach is concerned that RB-INSERT-FIXUP might set T:nil:color to RED, in which case the test in line 1 would not cause the loop to terminate when z is the root. Show that the professor's concern is unfounded by arguing that RB- INSERT-FIXUP never sets T:nil:color to RED}{3}}

Professors Skelton and Baron are concerned that at the start of case 1 of RB-DELETE-FIXUP, the node x:p might not be black. If the professors are correct, then lines 5 - 6 are wrong. Show that x:p must be black at the start of case 1, so that the professors have nothing to worry about.}{3}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {5} Problem 14.2-2 on page 347. Can we maintain the black-heights of nodes in a red-black tree as attributes in the nodes of the tree without affecting the asymptotic performance of any of the red- black tree operations? Show how, or argue why not. How about maintaining the depths of nodes?}{4}}
